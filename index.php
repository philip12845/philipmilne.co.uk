    	    	<p>Thanks for visiting my not quite finished website, I'm a driven IT professional with a passion for technology and a knack for problem-solving. Recently completing a Level 3 ICT (Information Communications Technician) apprenticeship, With hands-on experience managing Linux servers and a range of other technologies at ANS, a tech support company in Manchester, I thrive on challenging projects the most recent of which includes re-installing our backup servers to upgrade the Operating System and backup software in use on them. This provides better customer experience as well as ensuring that unnecessary tickets aren't being raised improving efficiency and decreasing the amount of older servers in use.</p>
            	<p>In addition to my technical skills, I excel in customer service, managing client requests and ensuring their needs are met promptly and efficiently. At ANS, I've earned a reputation for my dedication and hard work, consistently ranking at the top for calls taken and tickets completed. Beyond the world of IT, I find joy in outdoor walks with friends, gaming, and nurturing my collection of fish and houseplants â€“ my planted fish tank is home to a vibrant community of aquatic life including a Golden Nugget Pleco, Bloodfin Tetras, Gold Rams, Amano Shrimp and some other things.</p>
